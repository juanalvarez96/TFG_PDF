\chapter{State of the Art}
\label{chap:enabling_technologies}
This chapter will serve as a complilation of past work in automatic sarcasm detecction.
Firstly, a brief introduction on the main learning technologies used for text-based learning will be given. Moreover, an analysis on automatic sarcasm detection will be briefed. Finally the main issues found in automatic sarcasm detection shall be overviewed.

\section{Introduction}
Sarcasm detection is an important component for~\ac{nlp} very relevant to natural language understanding, dialogue systems and text mining~\cite{khodak2017large}.\\ The perspective followed in this chapter is merely to give a glimpse to the reader of the state-of-the-art technologies used by other researchers in this field. \\
The chapter will begin by defining sarcasm and its context. 
\section{Sarcasm} 
\subsection{Sarcasm Definition~\cite{joshi2017automatic}}
The Free Dictionary\footnote{www.thefreedictionary.com} defines sarcasm as a form of verbal irony that is intended to express contempt or ridicule . The subjective characteristic of sarcasm makes sarcasm very difficult to detect since a word may have a literal meaning and a sarcastic meaning. As a result, sarcasm automatic detection presents a big challenge. \\
Typically, sarcasm detection has been formulated as a classification problem . In that sense, given a text the goal is to predict whether or not the text is sarcastic. However, the big challenge is to label the text, since the classifier is supposed to distinguish between irony,  humour and other sentimental meanings.\\
In linguistics, sarcasm is a form of figurative language where the literal meaning of words does not hold, and instead the opposite interpretation is intended. Sarcasm is a type of irony. 

\section{Dataset~\cite{joshi2017automatic}}

As a matter of a fact, the studies already done in automatic sarcasm detection depend entirely on the dataset. That is why it is convenient to divide them into three kinds:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Short texts}: The social network Twitter is extremely popular due to its popularity among users. It can serve as an example of short text since every tweet is restricted to not exceed an amount of words. One approach to obtain labels for the tweets is to manually mark them as sarcastic or non-sarcastic. Another approach is the hashtag-based supervision. Hashtags can reveal when a tweet is labeled as sarcastic. By introducing the \textit{sarcasm} label, the author makes clear his intention to use sarcasm.  This allows the dataset to be bigger. Many works using this variation have been reported since its popularity has constantly grown. One of the problems with Twitter is the text length restriction. If the tweet length exceeds the tweet restriction limit, the author is going to be forced to introduce abreviations to the words used. As a consequence, sarcasm detection is going to be harder since the words are not going to be correctly spelled.
	\item \textit{Long texts}: The information usually comes from reviews, posts, news, articles. Some of the popular platforms for sentiment analysis in long texts are Imdb (for film critiques) and reddit. 
	\item \textit{Other data-sets}
\end{itemize}

It is noteworthy to mention the emphasis made on the Twitter social network since this project will be focusing on a Spanish set of tweets to detect sarcasm. Please note that this project will be developped for short texts. Hence, all the conclusions made are only valid for short texts.

\section{Approaches used for Sarcasm Detection}
\label{sec:sarcasmapproach}
In this section, several approaches used for detecting sarcasm will be discussed. In general, approaches for sarcasm detection can be classified into rule-based, statistical and deep learning-based approaches~\cite{joshi2017automatic}.
\subsection{Rule-based Approaches~\cite{joshi2017automatic}}
Rule-based approaches work by identifying sarcasm through a set or rules based upon evidence. The evidence is captured by using rules relying upon sarcasm. For instance, one rule can rely on Google to determine how likely that smile is while another rule can come from hashtag analysis.\\ By identifying the hashtags present in a tweet, a sarcasm pattern could be found. If the sentiment detected in the tweet does not match with the hashtag, then that tweet is labelled as sarcastic.\\ Furthermore, one could find sarcasm if a positive verb happens in a negative situation phrase in a sentence. The problem here is extracting the set of negative situation phrases. This is also known as a rule-based approach.
\subsection{Feature sets \cite{joshi2017automatic}}
This kind of approach use some of the technologies described below. In this project, there was a combination of features and learning algorithms but, in contrast, no deep learning technologies were implemented.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Features Used:} Most of these approaches use bag-of-words as features that have been found by statistical sarcasm detection. Apart from finding the features, some other works focus on designing pattern-based features, that are able to indicate sarcastic patterns on the corpus. The majority of the features used can be found on~\cref{fig:featused}. To allow the classifier to spot sarcastic patterns, these pattern-based features take three real values: exact match, partial match and no match. Furthermore, pragmatic features, like emoticons, can also be considered. The contextual sarcastic features (i.e. features that depend on previous messages) are not considered here.
	\item \textit{Learning Algorithms:} A variety of classifiers have already been experimented for sarcasm detection.~\acf{svm} is quite often present in sarcasm detection classification techniques. Moreover, many other works have used~\acf{lr},~\acf{nb} and Random Forests.
	\item \textit{Deep Learning-based Approaches:} Although nowadays deep learning has raised a lot of awareness, there are still few approaches reported for automated sarcasm detection. Similarity between word embeddings as features for sarcasm detection has been used. This augments features based on similarity of word embeddings related to other word pairs and report an improvement on performance. Convolutional neural networks have also been used, reporting an improvement of $2\%$ in performance.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}
To put it in a nutshell, different techniques for automatic sarcasm detection can be performed. Despite these numerous techniques, sarcasm automatic detection is difficult to detect since a word can have a literal meaning but also a sarcastic meaning that is not so easily labelled.

\section{Main Issues in Sarcasm Detection}
There are three main issues present in sarcasm automatic detection techniques~\cite{joshi2017automatic}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Data:} Even though hashtag-based labelling can provide large-scale supervision, the quality of the dataset can be doubtful. For example, let us take the hashtag \textit{\#not} very often present in tweets. Is this supposed to express sarcasm in the sentence or is it simply used to express a negation? In most of the works, this problem is tackled by removing the \textit{\#not} in the pre-processing step and analyzing the sentence. However, this may as well not be the optimum solution. Another solution is to use as test set some manually labelled tweets and as train set a hashtag labelled set. 
	\item \textit{Features as Sentiment:} The question is how can sentiment be detected in a sentence? In the case of sarcasm, some answers have already been given. If a negative phrase occurs in a positive sentence then that sentence has most likely sarcasm. In a statistical classifier, surface polarity can be used as a feature of the tweet. To capture surface polarity one has to analyze two emotions: activation and pleasantness. This can lead to a $4\%$ improvement in the accuracy~\cite{joshi2017automatic}.
	\item \textit{Skewed Data-sets: }
	Sarcasm is hard to find in an expression. For that reason, skew is reflected in data-sets.
\end{itemize}
